# Creating a Dynamic UI with Mantine, Next.js, and GPT-3.5

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic UI that can display the results generated by the GPT-3.5 API in an intuitive manner. The UI should be flexible enough to handle a wide range of responses and provide a seamless user experience.

To achieve this goal, we will be using Mantine and Next.js. Mantine is a React component library that provides a set of customizable UI components, while Next.js is a React framework that allows us to build server-side rendered applications.

To run the app locally, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neilchetna/Dynamic-UI.git
```

2. Install the dependencies using pnpm: 

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

```bash
OPENAI_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

Note: You will need to sign up for the OpenAI API and obtain an API key to use the GPT-3.5 API.

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server and you should be able to access the app by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
